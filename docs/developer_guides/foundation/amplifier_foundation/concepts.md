# Core Concepts

> **Coming Soon**: This page is under development. See the [amplifier-foundation repository](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation) for current documentation.

Mental model for understanding bundles, composition, mount plans, and the philosophy behind amplifier-foundation.

## What to Expect

This page will cover:

- **What is a Bundle?** - Structure and purpose
- **Composition Model** - How bundles layer and merge
- **Mount Plans** - The output consumed by AmplifierSession
- **PreparedBundle** - Ready for execution
- **@Mention Resolution** - Resolving context references
- **Philosophy** - Mechanism, not policy

## Temporary Reference

For now, see:
- [CONCEPTS.md](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation/blob/main/docs/CONCEPTS.md) in the amplifier-foundation repository
- [Getting Started](getting_started.md) for practical examples
- [Bundle System](bundle_system.md) for implementation details
