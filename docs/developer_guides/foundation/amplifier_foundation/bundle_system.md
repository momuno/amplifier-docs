# Bundle System Deep Dive

> **Coming Soon**: This page is under development. See the [amplifier-foundation repository](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation) for current documentation.

Detailed guide to the bundle system: loading, composition, validation, and preparation.

## What to Expect

This page will cover:

- **Loading Bundles** - From git URLs, local paths, with subdirectories
- **Composition** - Merge rules for each section
- **Validation** - Structure and completeness checks
- **Preparation** - Module resolution and downloading
- **BundleRegistry** - Caching and tracking bundles

## Temporary Reference

For now, see:
- [BUNDLE_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation/blob/main/docs/BUNDLE_GUIDE.md) in the amplifier-foundation repository
- [Examples](examples/) for practical usage
